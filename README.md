# Contemporary Music Recommendation System using Historical Preferences
## Overview
Many of us who are at the age when AARP cards arrive in the mail are still listening to the music of our highschool and college days. Exposure to new music has diminished due to the decreased use of the radio as part of our daily routines. Spotify, iTunes, Pandora, and other music apps provide a plethora of music options, and they make recommendations for other music based on a playlist, but most often those recommendations are of the same time period and genre.

### Problem
Many of us would like to try new music, but don’t know where to start, and don’t have the patience or time to research or listen to new music as a hit or miss exercise.

### Solution
My objective is to develop a recommendation system to highlight new songs and artists for listeners based on their historical music preferences.
